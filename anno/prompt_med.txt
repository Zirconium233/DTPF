**Task Description**
This project focuses on medical image fusion, particularly for multimodal medical images like CT-MRI, PET-MRI, SPECT-MRI, and other imaging modalities. The text annotations will guide the fusion process by describing the key characteristics and quality aspects of each modality that need to be preserved or enhanced.

**Annotation Requirements**
Each dataset sample requires:
1. **Image Quality Description**: A precise description of the image characteristics and quality factors that are crucial for medical diagnosis.

**Annotation Format**
The annotations follow this format for consistent parsing:

**Example Output**

```
Event Type: Contrast Enhancement
Description: The MRI image shows strong soft tissue contrast that needs to be preserved, while the CT image provides clear bone structure details.

Event Type: Edge Preservation
Description: Critical anatomical boundaries are visible in both modalities, requiring precise edge preservation during fusion.

Event Type: Noise Suppression
Description: The CT image contains quantum noise that should be reduced while maintaining structural integrity.

Event Type: Detail Enhancement
Description: Fine anatomical structures in the brain tissue need to be enhanced while preserving the overall contrast.

Event Type: Structure Consistency
Description: Both modalities show complementary structural information that must be accurately aligned and preserved.

Event Type: Artifact Reduction
Description: The MRI image shows minor motion artifacts that should be minimized in the fusion process.

**Loss Weight Rationale**
- Contrast Enhancement: max_ratio=10, consist_ratio=6, text_ratio=8
  (Preserving contrast is crucial for diagnostic accuracy)
  
- Edge Preservation: max_ratio=12, consist_ratio=8, text_ratio=6
  (Sharp edges are essential for identifying anatomical boundaries)
  
- Noise Suppression: max_ratio=8, consist_ratio=10, text_ratio=6
  (Balance between noise reduction and detail preservation)
  
- Detail Enhancement: max_ratio=10, consist_ratio=8, text_ratio=8
  (Fine anatomical details are critical for diagnosis)
  
- Structure Consistency: max_ratio=12, consist_ratio=10, text_ratio=6
  (Maintaining structural integrity across modalities)
  
- Artifact Reduction: max_ratio=8, consist_ratio=12, text_ratio=8
  (Minimizing artifacts while preserving important features)

**Instructions for the LLM**
Based on the medical image pairs, your task is to:
1. Analyze the quality and characteristics of each medical image modality
2. Generate descriptions focusing on clinically relevant features
3. Identify specific image quality aspects that need attention during fusion
4. Follow the exact two-line format as shown in the examples
